YES, the project compiles successfully on X86 Linux. It utilizes a standard CMake build system and, after installing dependencies like Protobuf and OpenSSL development libraries and initializing Git submodules for GTest, it configured and built without errors using GCC/Clang toolchains.
YES, this project is a high-value fuzzing target. It is implemented as a C++ static library (`libsecuremessage.a`) that processes structured data (Google Protocol Buffers, as indicated by `securemessage.proto` and related C++ files) and cryptographic operations (via `crypto_ops.cc` and `crypto_ops_openssl.cc`). This directly aligns with heuristic #1 (complex file formats/structured data) and #3 (library for wider use, security-critical component). The presence of parsing logic (`raw_secure_message_parser.cc`, `secure_message_parser.cc`) suggests intricate state machines and potential pointer manipulation within the parsing and cryptographic routines, satisfying heuristic #2 (code complexity). Furthermore, the modular nature of the library, with dedicated parsing components, provides clear and isolated entry points for a fuzzing harness, meeting heuristic #4 (fuzzing harness feasibility).
