YES, the project uses a standard CMake build system with C++11 and C99 standards, and includes X86-specific optimizations (AVX2, SSE4.1) configured for typical X86 Linux toolchains (GCC/Clang). While it requires the Abseil library in `third_party/abseil-cpp` for a full build of examples/tests, this is a common external dependency that can be resolved, indicating fundamental compilability on X86 Linux.
YES, this project is a high-value fuzzing target. It is a library (`libgav1`) designed for parsing a complex media format (AV1 video bitstreams), which represents a significant attack surface involving untrusted external input (heuristic #1). Video decoding logic is inherently complex, featuring intricate parsing, large state machines, and likely manual memory management (as suggested by `libgav1_dsp.cmake` and `libgav1_decoder.cmake` inclusions) (heuristic #2). As a shared library, `libgav1` is intended for broad integration into applications like media players and web browsers, making any vulnerability critical due to potential widespread impact and exposure to remote attackers (heuristic #3). Its structure as a library strongly suggests the presence of clear, self-contained API functions for bitstream processing, which are ideal entry points for a fuzzing harness (heuristic #4).
