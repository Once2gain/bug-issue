YES, the project uses Bazel as its primary build system, as evidenced by `BUILD.bazel`, `MODULE.bazel`, and the `bazel_build.sh` script. Bazel is a cross-platform build tool, and the `bazel test ink/...` command in the build script suggests it is configured to compile and test on a standard X86 Linux environment. The presence of `fuzztest.bazelrc` further confirms its compatibility with common X86 Linux toolchains (GCC/Clang via Bazel's C++ toolchain).
YES, this project is a high-value fuzzing target. It appears to be a C/C++ library for graphics or drawing functionalities (judging by directories like `ink/brush`, `ink/color`, `ink/geometry`, `ink/rendering`, `ink/strokes`). Such libraries commonly parse and process complex, untrusted external input (e.g., stroke data, vector formats, image definitions) (heuristic #1). Handling graphics data typically involves intricate parsing logic, complex algorithms for transformations and rendering, and often manual memory management for performance, making it prone to vulnerabilities (heuristic #2). The presence of a `jni/` directory indicates it's likely a shared library intended for integration with Java applications (e.g., Android), making it a critical component with broad potential impact if exploited (heuristic #3). Crucially, the project explicitly includes `fuzztest.bazelrc` which configures build options for fuzz testing, strongly suggesting that it is designed with fuzzability in mind and provides clear, isolated functions suitable for fuzzing harnesses (heuristic #4).
