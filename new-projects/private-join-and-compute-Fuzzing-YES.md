YES, the project uses Bazel as its primary build system, as indicated by `MODULE.bazel` and numerous `BUILD` files. Bazel is well-supported on X86 Linux, and the codebase primarily consists of standard C++ with common dependencies like OpenSSL, making it highly probable to compile without issues in a standard X86 Linux environment.

YES, this project is a high-value fuzzing target. It implements complex cryptographic protocols for "private join and compute," making the extensive `private_join_and_compute/crypto` directory a significant attack surface (heuristic #1). The cryptographic implementations, including big number arithmetic, elliptic curve operations, and various ciphers (e.g., Paillier, ElGamal, Dodis-Yampolskiy PRF), inherently involve intricate parsing, complex mathematical logic, and often manual memory management, indicating high code complexity and potential for vulnerabilities (heuristic #2). Given its nature, this project likely handles sensitive data and may be deployed in network-facing scenarios via its RPC implementation (`private_join_and_compute_rpc_impl`), making any discovered vulnerability high impact (heuristic #3). Finally, the codebase appears modular, with distinct client, server, and RPC components, suggesting that functions responsible for deserializing network messages or processing cryptographic inputs could serve as clear, isolated entry points for fuzzing harnesses (heuristic #4).
