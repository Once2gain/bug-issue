YES, the project uses a standard GN/Ninja build system (indicated by `BUILD.gn` and `DEPS`), which is widely supported on X86 Linux environments and is the typical build system for Chromium-based projects like WebRTC. There are no clear indicators of platform-specific dependencies that would prevent compilation on Linux.
YES, this project is a high-value fuzzing target. It appears to be the WebRTC library, which inherently processes complex and untrusted external input such as network protocols (e.g., RTP, STUN, ICE in `net/`, `p2p/`) and media formats (in `audio/`, `video/`, `media/`), making it a prime candidate for identifying attack surfaces (heuristic #1). The nature of real-time communication involves intricate parsing logic, complex state machines, and significant low-level memory management, suggesting high code complexity and potential for vulnerabilities (heuristic #2). As a foundational library for communication, it is designed for widespread integration (`sdk/`, `api/`) and is inherently network-facing, meaning any discovered vulnerability would have a critical impact (heuristic #3). Finally, the presence of `api/` and `native-api.md` indicates a structured library with well-defined interfaces, making it feasible to identify clear, self-contained functions suitable for fuzzing harnesses (heuristic #4).
