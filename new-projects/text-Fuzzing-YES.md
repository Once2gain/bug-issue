YES, the project uses Bazel as its build system, which is designed for reproducible builds across platforms, including X86 Linux. Its `WORKSPACE` file references common C++ libraries like ICU and SentencePiece, indicating it is structured to compile with standard toolchains orchestrated by Bazel, even though Bazel itself was not found in the current environment.
YES, this project is a high-value fuzzing target. It is a C/C++ library (`tensorflow_text`) intended for text processing, likely involving complex parsing of untrusted textual data (e.g., Unicode, tokenization rules) given its dependencies on `icu` and `sentencepiece` (heuristic #1). The nature of text processing inherently involves intricate parsing logic and state machines (heuristic #2). As a library integrated into TensorFlow, it is a critical component with broad potential impact if vulnerabilities are found (heuristic #3). The presence of `pybind11` suggests well-defined C++ APIs, making it highly feasible to identify clear, self-contained functions for a fuzzing harness (heuristic #4).
