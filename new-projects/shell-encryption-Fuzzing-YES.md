YES, the project utilizes a Bazel build system as indicated by `MODULE.bazel` and `BUILD` files, which is designed for cross-platform compilation, including X86 Linux environments. Although Bazel was not installed, the project's structure suggests it is intended to be compilable with the appropriate build tools.
YES, this project is a high-value fuzzing target. It is a C++ library named `shell_encryption` focused on cryptographic operations (Heuristic #3). The presence of `serialization.proto` indicates that the library processes complex, structured data (Protocol Buffers) which represents a significant attack surface (Heuristic #1). Cryptographic implementations, such as those implied by file names like `int256.h`, `montgomery.h`, and `dft_transformations.h`, inherently involve intricate mathematical logic and algorithms, making them complex and prone to vulnerabilities (Heuristic #2). The design as a library and the use of protobufs strongly suggest the existence of well-defined deserialization functions, which would serve as ideal, isolated entry points for a fuzzing harness (Heuristic #4).
